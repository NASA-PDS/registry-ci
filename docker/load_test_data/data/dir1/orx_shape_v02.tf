OSIRIS-REx Target Body DSK Surface ID Codes
========================================================================

   This kernel contains a set of OSIRIS-REx Target Body DSK Surface ID
   Codes for Bennu. 


Version and Date
========================================================================

   Version 0.1 - May 7, 2019 - Michael Nolan / U Arizona

      First version. Model is "SPC v020", based on [3] and [4] and is
      delivered at ~3-m sample spacing.

   Version 0.2 - Aug 5, 2020 - Michael Nolan / U Arizona and Ray 
      Espiritu / Johns Hopkin University Applied Physics Laboratory.

      Added model "ALT v020", based on [5], and is delivered at 3-m and
      80-cm spacing globally and 5-cm near the planned TAG sites.

Implementation Notes
========================================================================

   This file is used by the SPICE system as follows: programs that make
   use of this frame kernel must `load' the kernel, normally during
   program initialization. The SPICELIB routine FURNSH and CSPICE
   function furnsh_c load a kernel file into the kernel pool as shown
   below.

      CALL FURNSH ( 'frame_kernel_name' )
      furnsh_c    ( "frame_kernel_name" );

   This file was created and may be updated with a text editor or word
   processor.


Definition Section
========================================================================

   This section contains name to ID mappings for the OSIRIS-REx target
   body DSK surfaces. These mappings are supported by all SPICE
   toolkits with integrated DSK capabilities (version N0066 or later).

   The IDs have the form PRRRRRVVV, where P is a 1 digit kind / producer
   / technique identifier (tru=1, spc=2, ola=3), RRRRR is a 5 digit
   resolution in mm (1254, 0790, 0030, 0005), VVV is a 3 digit version
   (120, 450). Note that each producer may have models with the same
   version numbers.

Version 0.1

   The previous Version 0.1 contains the project-official shape
   model "SPC v020" generated Jan 21 2019. That model was produced at
   multiple resolutions; this version is the model at ~ 3m ground
   sample distance. The model is described in [3] and [4].

Version 0.2

   This current version 0.2 contains the contents of version 0.1 and
   adds project-official shape model "ALT v020" generated April 14 2020.
   That model was produced at multiple resolutions using OLA laser
   altimetry as described in [5]. These versions are global models at
   ~3m and ~88-cm spacing and local models near the selected TAG sites
   at 5-cm spacing. Note that the SPCv020 model and the ALTv020 model
   are completely different: The version numbers being the same is a
   coincidence.
